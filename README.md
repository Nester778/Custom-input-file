# Custom-input-file
In this project I made a custom input file to work with images, but it will work with any kind of file. I used node as the server, and mongodb to save the image. To launch the application, you need to run the app.js file, the application is launched at http://localhost:3030. Custom input file can select several files, add files to already selected ones, displays already selected files, when you click on the selected files, they open in full screen, and also delete already selected files. All logic is in the scripts folder.
